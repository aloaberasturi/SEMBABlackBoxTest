#It is also possible to choose to launch a case with an .nfde, .cmsh and .conf 
#files as input (i.e, skipping the call to SEMBA). For that purpose, an
#["execution"] flag is suplied: 
#    -[execution] : "normal"  --will launch BOTH semba and ugrfdtd
#    -[execution] : "ugrfdtd" --will just lunch ugrfdtd
#
#
#Before execution, please remember to add semba and ugrfdtd executables (or links)
#in the /bin folder.
